# hardin_heapalloc
A dynamic heap allocator created for my CS 354 course

This project served as a way to build out a dynamic heap memory allocator. The allocator can allocate, coalesce, and udpate memory sizes as needed.

FILES MADE BY ALEJANDRO:

myHeap.c (there lies some globals/struct declarations that are not done by me but most of this file my commit)
